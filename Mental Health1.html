            <h2 class="head">Why Mental Health?</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="color: white;">   Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
             Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental, and social well-being.
            <br> <br>
             Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness. </p>

            <h2 class="head2">What causes mental illness?</h2>
            <br>
            <p> There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as <br> <br>
            <ul><li>Early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.)</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Use of alcohol or drugs</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Having feelings of loneliness or isolation</li></ul> </p>
            <br> <br>
            <h2 class="head3">Stress</h2>
            <br>
            <p> Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure. </p> <br>
