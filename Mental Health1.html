            <h2 class="head">Why Mental Health?</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="color: white;">   Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
             Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental, and social well-being.
            <br> <br>
             Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness. </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="head2">What causes mental illness?</h2>
            <br>
            <p> There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as <br> <br>
            <ul><li>Early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.)</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Use of alcohol or drugs</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Having feelings of loneliness or isolation</li></ul> </p>
            <br> <br>
            <h2 class="head3">Stress</h2>
            <br>
            <p> Stress is the feeling of being overwhelmed or unable to cope with mental or emotional pressure. </p> <br>

            <h3 class="head4">What is stress?</h3>
            <br>
			<div>
				<img class="test1" src="D:\web assignmnt\Mental Health.html\Images\Mental-Health-1.jpg" alt="stress">
				<p class="test" style="color: white;"> Stress is our body’s response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new, unexpected or that threatens our sense of self, or when we feel we have little control over a situation. <br>We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life events, personality and social and economic circumstances. <br>
				When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system. This helps us respond quickly to dangerous situations. <br> <br>
				Sometimes, this stress response can be useful: it can help us push through fear or pain so we can run a marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our stress hormones will usually go back to normal quickly once the stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting effects. <br>
				However, too much stress can cause negative effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect our physical and mental health. </p> <br> <br>

				<br><br>
				<h3 class="head4">What makes us stressed?</h3> <br> <br>
				<p> Many things that can lead to stress: bereavement, divorce or separation, losing a job or unexpected money problems. Work-related stress can also have a negative impact on your mental health. People affected by work-related stress lose an average of 24 days of work due to ill health. <br>
				Even positive life changes, such as moving to a bigger house, gaining a job promotion or going on holiday can be sources of stress. If you feel stressed in these situations you may struggle to understand why or be unwilling to share your feelings with others. </p> <br> <br>

				<p class="test" > You can’t avoid stress, but you can stop it from becoming overwhelming by practicing some daily strategies: </p> <br>
	
				<ul><li>Exercise when you feel symptoms of stress coming on. Even a short walk can boost your mood.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>At the end of each day, take a moment to think about what you’ve accomplished — not what you didn’t get done.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>Set goals for your day, week and month. Narrowing your view will help you feel more in control of the moment and long-term tasks.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>Consider talking to a therapist or your healthcare provider about your worries.</li></ul>

				<p> Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable.
