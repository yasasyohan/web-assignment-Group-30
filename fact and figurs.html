    <h4>Child health</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
    In 2018 an estimated 6.2 million children and adolescents under the age of 15 years died, mostly from <br>
    preventable causes. Of these deaths, 5.3 million occurred in the first 5 years, with almost half of these in<br>
    the first month of life.<br><br></li>

    <li>Despite determined global progress, an increasing proportion of child deaths are in Sub-Saharan Africa and<br> 
    Southern Asia. Four out of every five deaths of children under age five occur in these regions.<br><br></li>

    <li>Children in sub-Saharan Africa are more than 15 times more likely to die before the age of 5 than children in <br> 
    high income countries.<br><br> </li>

    <li>Malnourished children, particularly those with severe acute malnutrition, have a higher risk of death from<br>  
    common childhood illness such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria. Nutrition-related factors contribute<br> 
    to about 45per cent of deaths in children under-5 years of age.<br> <br> <br> </li>

    </ul>
    
    <h4>Maternal health</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Over 40 per cent of all countries have fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people; over 55 per cent of <br> 
        countries have fewer than 40 nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000 people.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>In Eastern Asia, Northern Africa and Southern Asia, maternal mortality has declined by around two-thirds.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>Every day in 2017, approximately 810 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and <br> 
        childbirth.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>94per cent of all maternal deaths occur in low and lower middle-income countries.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>Young adolescents (ages 10-14) face a higher risk of complications and death as a result of pregnancy <br> 
        than other women.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>But maternal mortality ratio – the proportion of mothers that do not survive childbirth compared to those <br> 
        who do –   in developing regions is still 14 times higher than in the developed regions.<br> <br> <br> </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>38 million people globally were living with HIV in 2019.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>25.4 million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy in 2019.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>1.7 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2019.<br> <br></li> 

    <li>690 000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2019.<br><br>  </li>

    <li>75.7 million people have become infected with HIV since the start of the epidemic.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>32.7 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the epidemic.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, accounting for around one<br> 
    in three AIDS-related deaths.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>Globally, adolescent girls and young women face gender-based inequalities, exclusion, discrimination and <br> 
    violence, which put them at increased risk of acquiring HIV.<br> <br> </li>

    <li>HIV is the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age worldwide.<br><br> </li> 

    <li>AIDS is now the leading cause of death among adolescents (aged 10–19) in Africa and the second most<br>  
    common cause of death among adolescents globally.<br> <br></li> 

    <li>Over 6.2 million malaria deaths have been averted between 2000 and 2015, primarily of children under five <br> 
    years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. The global malaria incidence rate has fallen by an estimated 37 per cent <br> 
    and the mortality rates by 58 per cent.<br> <br> </li>
