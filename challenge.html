    <p> Donation of hand sanitizers and face masks for people with low income - SamajaSathkara.lk Foundation </p>
 <h3> More about that </h3>
 <p> We donated two facemasks and a bottle of hand sanitizer to each family while distributing dry rations and a few extra facemasks were provided to families with several children. At the same time, they were made aware of how to use them and importance of using them. This programme was conducted by going from house to house without a single gathering.<br> <br>  As the second phase, we donated facemasks to families in the Mahiyanganaya area, which is about 260 kilometers from Colombo.

  Here we donated high quality facemasks in blue, light green and pink with the help of our Fundraiser, and if there are several people in one house, we donated facemasks donated by MAS, one of Sri Lanka’s leading apparel companies. (Masks in other colors in the photographs are donated by the MAS)</p>

      <h3>Ndola Medntal Hospital in Zambia</h3>
    <p> According to the 2021 Mental Health Statistics, mental health and substance use disorders affected 13 per cent of the world's population.
That number could increase as people around the world face various challenges and try to adjust to a new normal amid the coronavirus pandemic.
<br><br>For several years,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> Chainama Hills Hospital in Lusaka has been offering mental health services to an ever growing population in the country.
However, in a bid to decentralise mental health services in various parts of Zambia, the Government decided to construct another psychiatric hospital in Ndola in the Copperbelt region.
But for close to eight years now since construction works at the Ndola's Psychiatric Hospital commenced, the project is yet to be completed.<br>
 Nevertheless, there are renewed hopes under the current UPND administration that the stalled works at the facility are expected to resume following the approval of cost variation by the Ministry of Justice.
The psychiatric hospital, whose works have stalled, is being constructed under Ndola Teaching Hospital (NTH).</span> </p>

  <h3> Age International's pop-up clinics</h3>
  <p>Myanmar only has six doctors for every 10,000 people, compared to the UK’s 28. For those that live in urban areas, a visit to the doctor can be difficult to afford. If you are poor, older, and living in a rural area, it can be impossible. 

“It’s hard to get to a doctor here; money is a real obstacle," Dr May (photographed) explains. "Older people need care left, right and centre but, when they don’t have help from their families, they suffer.” 

Age International’s pop-up clinics in Myanmar are bringing healthcare to the older people who need it most. Dr May travels to some of the most rural locations in the country, providing free check-ups, advice and medication. For the older people who visit her, the clinic is a lifeline.

  <h3>Let's keep the environment clean,Let's get tid of DENGUE</h3>
  <p>Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. The primary vectors that transmit the disease are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus.Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death in some Asian and Latin American countries. It requires management by medical professionals.<br><br>But it is our duty to help prevent dengue as much as we can.So,we also had the opportunity to assist in curbing the spread of the dengue manace throughout the country by providing our support for a dengue labor donation.<br>
 <br>Keeping the environment around us clean will enable us and the country to escape from many catastrophic situations and live safely.Being clean is one of the most important requirements of our health.</p>

  <h3>Clean Water</h3>
  <p> For innocent Sri Lankan’s  who are susceptible to fatal kidney disease , this is an effort to provide them with clean drinking water.  To clean and clear water of heavy metal contaminants. This is the main goal of our project.<br>
 North central province is vital in the production of rice in the country. Most people living in this area are innocent farmers who depending on farming to sustain their daily lives. These days the water in this area contains a murky taste. This is mainly due to the high content of chemicals present in the water base.  Tests have shown up that the main cause of such chemicals in the water base originated from pesticides and fertilizer used for farming. Toxins such as  Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury are mixed with drinking water thus leading to deadly illnesses.
 The residet living in this are not only use this water for drinking  but also use the same contaminated water for cooking purposes as well. Due to this a large portion of innocent people in the north central province have been susceptible to fatal kidney illnesses. To explain further the epidemic caused by unclean water, in areas such as Padavi Parakramapura research has found that 20% of the residence suffer from kidney illnesses.<br>
 We selected a house and donated a filter to help people in these affected areas.We were all happy to be able to help them either way.

  <h3>Planting of herbs</h3>
  <p>Planting an herb garden is a wonderful way to enjoy the sights, smells and tastes of a wide variety of plants. Fresh herbs are often easy to cultivate and can grow in a small garden in the back yard, in pots on an outdoor patio or sunroom, or even in a window box inside a kitchen. Gardening is a terrific hobby. It is a great activity that can be shared with others  or even alone. Not only is gardening relaxing but it also improves hand-eye coordination, motor skills and self-esteem.


Herbs have many values but a few of the most common uses include aromatherapy, medicinal, as seasonings and flavorings in foods and beverages, and in salads. Many herbs are chockfull of cancer-fighting antioxidants, valuable nutrients, fat-free flavor, and more.<br>
<br>Valuable herbs play a vital role in our earth.We also contributed to do a valuable service to the country by planting a few herbs at home that will benefit everyone.</p>
