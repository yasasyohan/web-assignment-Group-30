    <p> Donation of hand sanitizers and face masks for people with low income - SamajaSathkara.lk Foundation </p>
 <h3> More about that </h3>
 <p> We donated two facemasks and a bottle of hand sanitizer to each family while distributing dry rations and a few extra facemasks were provided to families with several children. At the same time, they were made aware of how to use them and importance of using them. This programme was conducted by going from house to house without a single gathering.<br> <br>  As the second phase, we donated facemasks to families in the Mahiyanganaya area, which is about 260 kilometers from Colombo.

  Here we donated high quality facemasks in blue, light green and pink with the help of our Fundraiser, and if there are several people in one house, we donated facemasks donated by MAS, one of Sri Lankaâ€™s leading apparel companies. (Masks in other colors in the photographs are donated by the MAS)</p>

 <p> Siyabalanduwa is located in the district of Monaragala. Monaragala is one of the most undeveloped district in Sri Lanka with poverty.  Siyabalanduwa located 400 km away from Colombo. <br> <br>Doing donation projects with poorest families I have earlier identified few families from Siyabalanduwa.<br><br> Families that I have donated dry food items are daily labors and earn only little some of money.we have donated dry food items for these families which is enough for couple of weeks.

      <h3>Ndola Medntal Hospital in Zambia</h3>
    <p> According to the 2021 Mental Health Statistics, mental health and substance use disorders affected 13 per cent of the world's population.
That number could increase as people around the world face various challenges and try to adjust to a new normal amid the coronavirus pandemic.
<br><br>For several years,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> Chainama Hills Hospital in Lusaka has been offering mental health services to an ever growing population in the country.
However, in a bid to decentralise mental health services in various parts of Zambia, the Government decided to construct another psychiatric hospital in Ndola in the Copperbelt region.
But for close to eight years now since construction works at the Ndola's Psychiatric Hospital commenced, the project is yet to be completed.<br>
 Nevertheless, there are renewed hopes under the current UPND administration that the stalled works at the facility are expected to resume following the approval of cost variation by the Ministry of Justice.
The psychiatric hospital, whose works have stalled, is being constructed under Ndola Teaching Hospital (NTH).</span> </p>
