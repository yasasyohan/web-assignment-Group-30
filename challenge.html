    <p> Donation of hand sanitizers and face masks for people with low income - SamajaSathkara.lk Foundation </p>
 <h3> More about that </h3>
 <p> We donated two facemasks and a bottle of hand sanitizer to each family while distributing dry rations and a few extra facemasks were provided to families with several children. At the same time, they were made aware of how to use them and importance of using them. This programme was conducted by going from house to house without a single gathering.<br> <br>  As the second phase, we donated facemasks to families in the Mahiyanganaya area, which is about 260 kilometers from Colombo.

  Here we donated high quality facemasks in blue, light green and pink with the help of our Fundraiser, and if there are several people in one house, we donated facemasks donated by MAS, one of Sri Lankaâ€™s leading apparel companies. (Masks in other colors in the photographs are donated by the MAS)</p>

 <p> Siyabalanduwa is located in the district of Monaragala. Monaragala is one of the most undeveloped district in Sri Lanka with poverty.  Siyabalanduwa located 400 km away from Colombo. <br> <br>Doing donation projects with poorest families I have earlier identified few families from Siyabalanduwa.<br><br> Families that I have donated dry food items are daily labors and earn only little some of money.we have donated dry food items for these families which is enough for couple of weeks. Those families were very pleased to received such donation.</p>
